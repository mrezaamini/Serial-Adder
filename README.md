# GENERIC SERIAL ADDER
Sequential serial adders are economically efficient and simple to build. In serial adders, pairs of bits are added simultaneously during each clock cycle. This is a simple VHDL implementation of serial adder tested with serialAdder_tb as testbench.

## TEST:
for testing set a and b as input numbers in testbench and simulate it with softwares like modelsim. 
Test Example:
